Read your electricity meter in a battery friendly way by means of the pulse LED on your meter. Uses the ESP32 deep sleep capabilities to extend battery life. Inspired by Home Assistant Glow (https://glow-energy.io/)
## Motivation, the Journey and Beyond
My Electricity and Gas meters are outside the house and a long way from any power sources, how difficult could it be to run a glow setup from a battery! I soon discovered that a USB battery pack and the std glow config config would only get me a few days of operation and assuming i could keep the damed battery alive. So liking a challenge this project was born. If I knew then that it would take me 6 months plus to get to this stage I may have thought twice!

So I've re-written the glow logic to use the ESP32 deep sleep function and control the battery pack using USB C along with a small LIPO battery keeping the ESP powered while charging the battery pack. My current setup gives me 20-25 days of use per charge from a 10600 mAh battery, obviously this duration depends on your usage but I have an EV and electric water heating so this is a good indication. I will probably buy a bigger battery pack as I want to get to over a month between charges.

I would like to point out that this is my first ESP HOME project so any suggestions to improve the structure of the config and to reduce the power consumption whould be greatly appreciated. The same goes for the hardware setup.

## Hardware
Please note - This is ESP32 specific
As per Glow except:-
- Power efficient ESP (My choice FireBeetle ESP32 IOT Microcontroller(V3.0) uses just 10Î¼A in deep-sleep mode)
- LIPO battery (i've used a 2000mAh)
- USB Battery Pack with USB C port
- USB C breakout board (remove resistors)
- Some resistors and a 2N7000 MOSFET (or two)
- A toggle switch (Deep Sleep Enable)
- A push button (Cold Start)
- USB cables

## ESP Home Config
Highlights:-
In deep sleep mode following a pulse from the Photodiode and increamenting the counter the ESP will enter deep sleep until the next pulse or after a time delay which is ajusted to be just before the next Hour transistion when HA will be updated via the API.
Wake-up can take quite a while (250ms+), so there is a possibility of pulses being dropped so there is an attempt to calculate the duration beteen pulses and if below a certain limit keep the ESP awake until the frequecny of pulses drops to an acceptable level.
If the LIPO battery voltage drops below 3.4V the USB battery is enegised by pulling the CC pin to ground through a 4.7k resistor which simulated a cable insertion. The ESP is kept awake during this period
